1) Print all lines that contain a phone number with an extension (the letter x or X followed by four digits).
grep -P '(\d+\-){2}\d+ [xX]\d{4}' grepdata.txt

2) Print all lines that begin with three digits followed by a blank. Your answer must use the \{ and \} repetition specifier.
grep -P '^\d{3} .*$' grepdata.txt

3) Print all lines that contain a date. Hint: this is a very simple pattern. It does not have to work for any year before 2000.
My solution is not very simple :(
grep -P '(Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)\. [1-3]*[0-9]+\, 2\d{3}' grepdata.txt

4) Print all lines containing a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u) followed by a single character followed by the same vowel again. Thus, it will find “eve” or “adam” but not “vera”. Hint: \( and \)
grep -P '([aeiou]).\1' grepdata.txt

5) Print all lines that do not begin with a capital S.
grep -v '^S.*$' grepdata.txt


Write grep statements that use command-line options along with the pattern to do the following:

6) Print all lines that contain CA in either uppercase or lowercase.
grep -i 'ca' grepdata.txt

7) Print all lines that contain an email address (they have an @ in them), preceded by the line number.
grep -n '@' grepdata.txt

8) Print all lines that do not contain the word Sep. (including the period).
grep -v 'Sep\.' grepdata.txt

9) Print all lines that contain the word de as a whole word.
grep -w '\<de\>' grepdata.txt
